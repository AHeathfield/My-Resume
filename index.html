        <h3><u>About Me</u></h3>

            <p>
                My skills in giving and receiving criticism, organization, and working well in teams<br />
                make me a strong candidate for a position in the app development industry. In an app<br /> 
                development co-op course, I was able to pick up useful development skills while learning<br /> 
                SWIFT and Xcode. I was also able to network with professionals in the sector while I was<br />
                enrolled in this program. I completed many assignments that required me to debug and fix<br />
                code, which was able to improve my problem-solving abilities. I am also just starting my <br />
                web development journey and have already created many projects like this one.<br />

        <h3><u>Experience</u></h3>
            <h4>iOS Student Developer ~ App Development with Swift Co-Op Experience</h4>
                <h5>FEBRUARY 2023 - JUNE 2023</h5>
                    <p>
                        Formerly enrolled as a student in the App development with Swift Co-Op program, <br />
                        run by The Career Education Council, and Apple SWIFT<br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Gained lots of practical business knowledge in this program, as well as the SWIFT <br />
                        coding abilities I needed to develop my app.<br />
                    </p>
                    <p>   
                        After independently studying the app market, I devised my app idea, which I then <br />
                        proposed to numerous business owners at a school board- wide event representing <br />
                        the Co-Op.<br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Followed Apple Swift curriculum and finished DiS: Explorations workbook, where I <br />
                        further made a working prototype of my app, which I was able to present to local<br />
                        business owners and some Apple education team members.<br />
                    </p>

            <br />

            <h4>Mary Browns Chicken, Ancaster — Cook, Pack Line</h4>
                <h5>SEPTEMBER 2021 - PRESENT</h5>
                    <p>
                        I worked mainly as both Pack Line and the Cook at Mary Browns. I have been trained<br /> 
                        as Cashier as well.<br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During this employment, I had to work under pressure during rush hours, while also<br />
                        keeping the orders accurate, and being a member of the team. I also jumped between<br />
                        roles during all my shifts making me a very flexible worker.<br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Communication is a major part of this job. Not just being able to quickly communicate<br />
                        to my co-workers about orders but also just being friendly with everyone which makes <br />
                        the work more engaging and enjoyable.<br />
                    </p>
