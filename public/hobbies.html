        <h1>HOBBIES</h1>

            <h2>Sports</h2>
                <p>
                    I love playing many sports. The sport I mainly played was soccer where I was <br />
                    on Glanbrook's 2005 representative team. I quit in my grade 10 year due to COVID<br />
                    19 and never got back into soccer. I was however really interested in volleyball.<br />
                    In my grade 11 year I was to inexperienced to make the school team, but in my <br />
                    senior year I managed to make the cut. I also play tennis, I want to play more<br />
                    but club memberships are very expensive and my family and friends rarely want to<br />
                    play with me. In grade 11 I played in the GHAC Tennis tournamnet for the mens<br />
                    singles, and in grade 12 I played in the same tournamnet but in mixed doubles.<br />
                    Currently tennis is my favourite sport.<br />

            <h2>Creating</h2>
                <p>
                    I love creating things in general, whether it be coding, drawing,<br />
                    or building things. But my top 3 things to make have to be:<br />
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Video-Games</li>
                    <li>Websites</li>
                    <li>Drawings</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Making video games is definietly the coolest thing someone can make<br />
                    in my opinion. There's and endless amount of possibilities when making<br />
                    a game. Yes it is definietly a learning curve, it's not easy to make games<br />
                    but it is definielty fun to learn how. It's a combination of coding, design,<br />
                    creativity which is why I love making them. The last game I worked on<br />
                    was a project for my computer science class. It is a Multiplayer FPS game <br />
                    that people can play with there friends for free. If you want to give it<br />
                    a try <a href="https://aheathfield.itch.io/first-multiplayer-fps-culminating-assignment">CLICK HERE</a>

                <p>
                    I have recently just started making websites mainly for fun and as a side<br />
                    hustle. I really enjoy art especially digital art and this is another form<br />
                    of it that I think has one of biggest influences in the world. I once saw<br />
                    a developers portfolio and their website was just like inspiring to me it was<br />
                    really cool, it had like a game built in. I am working to one day be able<br />
                    to make cool websites like that.

                    For drawing I just find it relaxing and pretty cool when you finish a<br /> 
                    project. I primarily used pencil, pencil crayons, and markers to make<br /> 
                    my pieces. More recently I've been doing digital work in Photoshop and<br /> 
                    Adobe Illustrator. I competed in the Skills Ontario Graphic Design<br /> 
                    Presentation in 2023. I have experimented with other mediums too<br /> 
                    including pastels, paints and so on.<br />
